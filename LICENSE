The CHAD (Climate, Hydrology, Agriculture, & Decision-making) model
simulates interactions among some of the basic climatic, aquatic,
agricultural, and decision-making processes impacting operations of
farms in the Eastern Snake River Plain (ESRP). The aim of the model
is to support analysis of the relationships among water policy,
agricultural output, and farmer resilience, vulnerability, and
adaptive capacity (RVAC). The decision-making is powered by SOSIEL.
